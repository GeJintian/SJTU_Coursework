e1:Use pointers to convert a array containing six arrays which contain 2 elements.Then use the rule of calculation to convert cartesion to polar.
Then, return the pointer of the new array and print its containing.
e2:Use pointer to read the array,and find the maximum by replacing the smaller one by the larger one.Then, use the maximum as the upper bounde
to rand a new number r. Then, use pointer to read through the array to find numbers less than r.
e3:Use fgetsf to get the sentence and fscanf to get the word.Then, use pointer to read through the sentence.If the words in the sentence is
equal to the word,then n=n+1.The n is the result.
e4:First,use fgets to get the first line as a string.Then,calculate the times that backspace occurs.The method is the same as e3.Then we can
know how large is the matric.Then use malloc to get to two-dimensional arrays.Use fscanf to store the number and then use the rule of matric
to get three output.
e5:
e7:A linked list is a list of structure which contains data and a pointer point to the next structure.It can be used to handle the merge operation
of the linear table.
In e7,we set the first list by set a new structure and point the pointer to the second one.Set the last by set a new structure and point the 
pointer of the last second one to it.Delete first by free the memory and point the head to the second one and delete last by free the last and
point the last second to NULL.Split by point the end of the fist list to NULL and set a new head for the beginning of the second list.Merge by
point the end of the first to the head of the second.
